My first web crawler that creates a domain-specific site map, showing which static assets each page depends on

Install Python depencies via `requirements.txt` using `pip` (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then start crawling with

```bash
python run.py
```
